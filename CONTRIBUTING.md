# Contributing to Dali #  

I am happy to incorporate contributions and improvements.  As a rule, I am hoping to accomplish the following with this project:

1. Make a library that allows for idiomatic Golang GUI creation
1. Provide for all of the styling and interactability that HTML5 allows for
1. For the library user:  
   1. Minimize magic and secrets 
   1. Minimize necessary JavaScript
   1. Minimize necessary HTML
1. Quickly spin up distributable graphical applications that allow developers to leverage the power of Go
1. Allow the stength of diverse teams to make applications better:
   1. Support the incorporation of sophisticated stylesheets
   1. Support the incorporation of sophisticated javascript behaviors 
   1. Support the separation of layers: do not require the embedding of scripts and stylesheets

Things that are out-of-scope and that `dali` is not concerned with
1. Creating websites 
1. Creating webservers
1. Creating enterprise-scale applications / concurrent user sessions

intellectual properties.  If you find Dali useful or full of potential for your efforts, I am accepting patronage support at
